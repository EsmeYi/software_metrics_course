# Assignment 4

Design and develop a machine learning recommender system based on the data from a chosen open source repository
* The system should take one .csv file with the training data and one .csv file to make the recommendations
* The second .csv file should NOT be used to validate the training
* Note: you can exchange the .csv with a database file if you want to

Examples of recommendations to design (you can choose your own)
* Recommend which teams (2-3 teams) should fix a defect based on the fix history and the words used in the defect description
* Recommend which components (2-3 components) should be tested based on source code metrics (e.g. McCabe complexity)

Describe
* Which algorithm you used and why
* Which performance metrics you used and why (e.g. MCC. accuracy)
* Discuss the limitations of your recommendations
