 Program: Recursive Fibonacci Sequence in Python
 Author: Miroslaw Staron
 Generated with the assistance of ChatGPT
 
 Description:
   This program computes Fibonacci numbers using
   a recursive implementation. The user provides
   how many terms should be generated, and the
   program prints the sequence to the console.
 
 Notes:
   - Recursive implementation is elegant but may
     be inefficient for large inputs.
   - For performance, memoization or iteration
     should be considered in real-world systems.
