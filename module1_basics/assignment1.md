# Assignment 1: measurement instruments

In the first assignment, you need to define a QME/metric for the following concepts:

1. Lines of Code: logical, physical
2. McCabe Complexity
3. Fan-in
4. Fan-out

You also need to create measurement instruments for these metrics. 

You also should use these measurement instruments to measure the Linux kernel repository. 

Finally, use the measurement instrument on two other repositories. These repositories should have the following characteristics:
- more than 1 million LOC (physical)
- in two different programming languages that are different than C

To submit the results, prepare:
- github repo with your code for the measurement instrument
- report with the diagrams of your measurement
-- total for the entire repo
-- per module
-- describe what these metrics mean
