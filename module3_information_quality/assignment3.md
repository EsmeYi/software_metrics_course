Design and develop the IQ system to monitor these checks
* Must include the visualization

Choose one quality attribute (check) which cannot be checked automatically (e.g. reputability)
* Write how can you check it and how to visualize it


As always, deliver a report with your experiences. Provide github repo with your solution.
