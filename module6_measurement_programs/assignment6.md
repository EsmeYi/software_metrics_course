# Assignment 6

The goal of this assignment is to create a measurement program using ChatGPT or any other generative AI tool.

Your task is to create an entire measurement program based on the metrics that you select from the literature. 

1. Select at least 10 different papers that contain description of metrics
2. Use ChatGPT or any other tool to implement these metrics. If the paper has a tool already, you can use it, but you must make sure that it works on your data.
3. Connect the developed measurement instruments to existing data sources -- either at the company that you work with, or to an open source tool. You can also set up the tools yourself on your own server/computer.
4. Create a dashboard with all these metrics.
5. Collect the data on a daily basis
6. Take a screenshot of this dashboard every day for at least 5 days. 
7. If you work with a company, show this to a stakeholder and ask them about their feedback.
8. Write a report that discusses:<br/>
a) the metrics and their usefullness <br/>
b) how easy it was to implement the metrics based on the papers that defined them <br/>
c) remember to include the screenshots to the dashboard <br/>
d) if the data is not proprietary, please include the link to the github repo with your measurement program
