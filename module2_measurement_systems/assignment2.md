# Assignment 2

## Develop a measurement system for defect inflow
* Stakeholder: Project managet
* Information need: predict how many resources are needed next week

## Technology
* Anything you want, suggest Excel, Python, Tableau, Tibco Spotfire

# Points that I will assess
* I can see the base, derived measures and indicators (not in the code, but as data)
* I can clearly see the analysis model (not in the code, but as configuration)
* I can add/remove input data, i.e. number of defects in a week
* I can manipulate the number of weeks in the statistics (e.g. 1, 2, 3, x weeks ahead)


## Develop a measurement system for a metric of your choice
Design a measurement method to collect base base for your chosen metric

Choose a metrics of source code or code repository (e.g. Gerrit, Git), something that is NOT trivial, e.g:
* https://github.com/torvalds/linux
* https://github.com/GENIVI
* https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow

Choose a metric, e.g.:
* from the list here: https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/41120/1/gupea_2077_41120_1.pdf

Use a definition that is relevant for your research
* Find an interesting one on the internet
* Create a measurement instrument for that metric

Apply that measurement instrument to the chosen repository

Measure:
* 1 entity 
* > 10 entities
* Visualize using bar chart
